# The third ML project
This is a simple Machine Learning project to predict a currency exchange using Neural Network and some algorithms.
The model was created based on Skillbox 2 days intense course. The goal of the course was to build a somewhat solid model to predict USD\RUB exchange rates based on the dataset from Russian Central Bank. 
The .csv file is the source data (dataset) I used to build the model. The currency is USD\RUB price (the price in rubbles for 1$) , time period presented in the report is between 01.10.18 and 04.10.2019. The ML library is scikit-learn. I used seven ML-algorithms including a Neural Network to test the prediction accuracy.

On top of that, I've included a summary report inside the Jypiter Notebook with my observations regarding the algorithms and Neural Network performance.
